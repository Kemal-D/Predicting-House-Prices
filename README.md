House Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices using various features. Key steps taken in the project include:

Dataset Investigation: Conducted a descriptive analysis to understand the dataset.
Exploratory Analysis: Performed exploratory analysis to uncover additional insights.
Data Distribution: Checked the distribution of the data.
Feature Correlation: Analyzed different features for correlations.
Data Quality Checks: Investigated missing data and outliers.
Data Transformation: Applied transformations to normalize the data.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance the model.
Model Training: Trained a regression model that explains 80% of the variance in house prices.
This repository includes the code and steps to replicate the analysis and model training.
